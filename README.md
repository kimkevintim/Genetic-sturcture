# Rationlity test for raw AFLP data by genetic structure

There probalbe doesn't has "one" way to determine the rationality of genetic data for non-model organisms in wild.
We recommend to assess there genetic structure before further analysis. Because it usually correlated to their deographical distribution or phylogenetics. Result may help for evalute the rationality of raw data.

Three script are PCA, DAPC and NJ tree from two specise Rpc, Rpcf and their populations.
